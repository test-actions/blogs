Open Liberty 21.0.0.1-beta provides MP Rest Client 2.0 (which is part of MicoProfile 4.0), which adds support for HTTP proxy servers as well as automatically following HTTP redirects. Also, you can now use Kubernetes secrets in Liberty variables, plus Jakarta Faces Container 3.0 and Jakarta Enterprise Beans Persistent Timer 4.0 which are part of Jakarta EE 9.

THIS IS A TEST123

We have two beta packages for link:{url-about}[Open Liberty]:

* <<allbeta, All Beta Features>>: a larger package that contains all Open Liberty beta features (including Jakarta EE 9 beta features) and GA features and functions.
* <<jakarta, Jakarta EE 9 Beta Features>>: a lightweight package that contains only the Jakarta EE 9 features.

This means that you can now try out our in-development Open Liberty features by just adding the relevant coordinates to your build tools.

If you try either package, <<feedback, let us know what you think>>.
[#allbeta]
== All Beta Features package

The All Beta Features package includes the following beta features:

* <<MP, MP Rest Client 2.0>>
* <<kube, Using Kubernetes secrets in Liberty variables>>


[#MP]
=== MP Rest Client 2.0

MicroProfile REST Client is a type-safe client API enabling rapid development of applications capable of consuming RESTful services. Version 2.0 is the latest update and adds support for HTTP proxy servers, automatically following HTTP redirects, Server Sent Events, and additional configuration options for JSON-B providers and multiple query parameters.

To enable this feature, add `<feature>mpRestClient-2.0</feature>` to you list of features in the `<featureManager>` element. Like in the example bellow:

[source, xml]
----
    <featureManager>
        <feature>mpRestClient-2.0</feature>
    </featureManager>
----

Alternatively, the `microprofile-4.0` convenience feature can be used to used instead. Like in the example bellow:

[source, xml]
----
    <featureManager>
        <feature>microprofile-4.0</feature>
    </featureManager>
----

For examples of how to use these new features, please refer to the link:http://download.eclipse.org/microprofile/microprofile-rest-client-2.0-RC2/microprofile-rest-client-2.0-RC2.html[specification document] or the link:https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-rest-client[MP Rest Client project page].


[#kube]
=== Using Kubernetes secrets in Liberty variables

In a cloud environment, sensitive information such as passwords and OAuth tokens may be stored in Kubernetes secrets. To access these secrets today in Liberty via configuration variables they would need to be exposed as environment variables in a Kubernetes pod. This update will allow configuration variables to be automatically populated from Kubernetes secrets without having to expose them as environment variables.

To make use of this function, the Kubernetes secrets need to be mapped to the file system, either by using the service binding operator or by mounting the secrets to a volume in the pod definition. Files will be read from the location defined in the `SERVICE_BINDING_ROOT` environment variable, which defaults to `WLP_CONFIG_DIR`/bindings. The variable name will be taken from the name of the file, and the value will be the contents of the file.

For example, we may have a Kubernetes secret named 'account_database' that contains a username and password:

[.img_border_dark]
image::img/blog/blog_21001_beta_username_password.png[align="center",Image of Kubernetes secret named 'account_database']

The service binding operator can automatically map that secret to the file system, or it could be done manually in a deployment definition:

[.img_border_dark]
image::img/blog/blog_21001_deployment_definition.png[align="center",Image of Kubernetes secret named 'account_database']

The above definition will result in the files /bindings/account_db/username and /bindings/account_db/password being created when the pod is created. Liberty will create variables from both files, and users can access them using normal Liberty variable syntax, `${account_db/username}` and `${account_db/password}`.

* link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/[Kubernetes Secrets]

=== Try it now 

To try out these features, just update your build tools to pull the Open Liberty All Beta Features package instead of the main release. The beta works with Java SE 15, Java SE 11, or Java SE 8.

[#jakarta]
== Jakarta EE 9 Beta Features package

The main change visible to developers in Jakarta EE is the names of packages changing to accomodate the new `jakarta.*` namespace. In this Open Liberty beta, we have two new API Release Candidates to join the expanding library of supported Jakarta packages.


This Open Liberty beta introduces the following Jakarta EE 9 features which now possess their all-new Jakarta EE 9 package names:

* <<face, Jakarta Faces Container 3.0 (`facesContainer-3.0`)>>
* <<timer, Jakarta Enterprise Beans Persistent Timer 4.0 (`enterpriseBeansPersistentTimer-4.0`)>>

These join the Jakarta EE 9 features in link:https://openliberty.io/blog/?search=beta&key=tag[previous Open Liberty betas]:

* Jakarta WebSocket 2.0 (`websocket-2.0`; now with full CDI integration)
* RESTful Web Services 3.0 (`restfulWS-3.0` and `restfulWSClient-3.0`)
* Jakarta Server Faces 3.0 (`faces-3.0`)
* Jakarta Connectors 2.0 (`connectors-2.0`)

* Jakarta Expression Language 4.0 (`el-4.0` now `expressionLanguage-4.0`)

[#face]
=== Jakarta Faces Container 3.0

This feature is part of the Jakarta EE9 features. The largest change in this feature is it has been updated to support and reference the new jakarta namespace. Previously the jsfContainer features supported the javax namespace, but as part of Jakarta EE9, the packages were updated from javax to jakarta.

The Open Liberty `facesContainer-3.0` allows developers to use their preferred Jakarta Server Faces API & Implementation, such a Mojarra, by bundling it with their application. Historically, this container feature has been named using the acronym jsf (such as `jsfContainer-2.3`). However, starting with Jakarta Faces Container 3.0, the feature name will now begin with faces to move away from the Oracle trademarked acronyms. Otherwise, developers can simply use the Open Liberty provided `faces-3.0` feature which uses the Apache MyFaces API and Implementation.

The following feature can be included in your server.xml:

[source, xml]
----
    <featureManager>
        <feature>facesContainer-3.0</feature>
    </featureManager>
----

Additional information about the Jakarta Server Faces 3.0 specification can be found link:https://jakarta.ee/specifications/faces/3.0/[here].

[#timer]
=== Jakarta Enterprise Beans Persistent Timer 4.0

The `enterpriseBeansPersistentTimer-4.0` feature enables the use of persistent timers in Jakarta Enterprise Beans. Configuration is the same as the corresponding feature from Jakarta EE 8,  `ejbPersistentTimer-3.2`.  With this final Jakarta Enterprise Beans 4.0 feature, the full capabilities of Jakarta Enterprise Beans 4.0 are now available in beta.


Enable the Jakarta EE 9 beta features in your app's `server.xml`. You can enable the individual features you want or you can just add the Jakarta EE 9 convenience feature to enable all of the Jakarta EE 9 beta features at once:

[source, xml]
----
  <featureManager>
    <feature>jakartaee-9.0</feature>
  </featureManager>
----

Or you can add the Web Profile convenience feature to enable all of the Jakarta EE 9 Web Profile beta features at once:

[source, xml]
----
  <featureManager>
    <feature>webProfile-9.0</feature>
  </featureManager>
----

=== Try it now

To try out these Jakarta EE 9 features on Open Liberty in a lightweight package, just update your build tools to pull the Open Liberty Jakarta EE 9 Beta Features package instead of the main release. The beta works with Java SE 15, Java SE 11, or Java SE 8.
